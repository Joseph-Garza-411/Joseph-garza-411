- ðŸ‘‹ Hello! My name's Francisco Garza but I go by Joseph Garza! I've liked the way it rings in my ears and sounds forever. Exercising and enjoying splendid meals is my passion. I have enjoyed working with languages and recently endeavored into language interpretation. My aim is to develop a portfolio website where I can shed light on all things interpretation.
